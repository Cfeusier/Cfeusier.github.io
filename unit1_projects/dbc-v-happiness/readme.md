# U1.W3: Design Your Own Code Combat Mission SOLO CHALLENGE

**This is a solo challenge. Refer to the [solo challenge](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/solo_challenges.md) guidelines.**

## Learning Competencies
- Define local variables in JavaScript
- Create, add properties to, delete properties from, and access values from JavaScript Object literals
- BONUS: Integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display and manipulate objects


## Summary
You now have some practice with JavaScript so let's get creative with it. In this challenge, **you are not expected to create a real, working mission on codecombat.com**, rather, we want you to have fun designing a simple mission and creating some basic objects and functions to manipulate those objects. You don't need to visit Code Combat to do this, just write out your solution in the `my_solution.js` file. The end is up to you. 

This is an open-ended challenge so there are a lot of things you can do with it (and ways to make it really hard or farily simple). It's up to you to decide how much detail you want to go in to. If you are having fun, keep working and solidifying your understanding of JavaScript concepts. If you're bored and feel like you've gotten enough out of it after writing a few objects and functions that work together, consider yourself done. That said, make sure you go through the workflow and complete each release. 


## Release 0: Design your Mission

Write an outline of your mission in comments in your [my_solution.js](my_solution.js) file. Here are some things to think about:

1. Think of some objects and things you would like those objects to do
2. Create a couple objectives (refer to the code combat mission objectives to tailor these to your mission)
3. Hover over the `this` in the code section of any mission. What is it referring to? An object? A function? What kinds of attributes do you want to add to your objects? Create your objects in JavaScript.
4. Think of the methods that are necessary to manipulate your objects and add them to your objects.  


## Release 1: [Pseudocode](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/pseudocode.md) 
Turn your objectives and objects into pseudocode. Write these in plain english and save them as comments. 

*NOTE: Make sure your pseudocode is broken down to easily implementable steps.*

## Release 2: Write your [initial code](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/initial_solution.md)
Your functions don't have to replicate movement on the screen (unless you want them to), but think about how to display something like movement using data structures.

## Release 3: [Refactor](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/refactoring.md)

## Release 4: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/reflection_guidelines.md)

## Optimize your Learning (Optional)
Add your JavaScript objects to an HTML page. Use CSS to make it pretty. What about ascii art? Then look up how to manipulate objects on a page with JavaScript using your functions...
