                    <h2>Wireframing and Designing This Website</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        This week and this post is all about making this website "mine" -- particularly from a design perspective. This will involve coming up with a rough plan and wireframe to shoot for, and then implementing that model in HTML and CSS. Because I am finishing this post after implementing the design, I can provide some better insight on my choices and the process than if I had written this completely before redesigning my site. This site should continually evolve, but for now, I am relatively pleased with the result because it feels like my personality. So, here is the wireframe that acts as the target of the design:</p>

                        <section>
                            <p>
                                <br />
                                Doesn't look too hard, right? Well, it was. The CSS in my media queries to get the site to look good on different devices took quite a bit of tinkering. The plan that I followed to execute this was as follows:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                First, start with the header and footer. Add an image icon and link that to your homepage. Then, add some borders and colors. Finally, tweak the border-radius on the bottom-left.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Next, add borders and colors to the main content area and the two sidebar containers. Add some border-radius to all of them on all sides. Repeat this for the dark full-width container at the bottom near the footer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That was pretty much all of it, except for chosing typography and writing rules of responsiveness. However, at the end it was too boring, so I chose a background, which I explain below.
                            </p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h3>The Background Choice...</h3>
                            <p>
                                A large part of this decision was my general nerd-like love of code. I am not referring to <em>coding</em> right now -- I am talking about how I love the <em><strong>look of code</strong></em>. Having come from a background in mathematics, physics, formal logic and the likes, I seem to have grown a strong aesthetic attachment to the syntaxes of artificial languages. There is something beautiful, complex yet elegant, powerful, and mystical about artificial languages -- I can't help but feel that when looking at code.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, I found some very standard and pretty Javascript to turn sideways and use as an translucent overlay that functions as a background. The trick at that point was making sure that it was opaque enough to see the code, but translucent enough that the typography on top of it was easily readable.
                            </p>
                        </section>
                        <p>
                            That was it. The funny thing is that after finishing this post, I am already ready to change the design! That will be left for another week :)
