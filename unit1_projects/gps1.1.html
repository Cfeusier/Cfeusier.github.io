			<h2>Driver</h2>
			<h4>Clark's "Feelings"</h4>
			<p>
				I am much more comfortable driving, but need to avoid driving all the time.
			</p>
			<h4>James's "Feelings"</h4>
			<p>
				In the driver role I find it difficult to maintain my focus and keep myself from wanting to dive off into other areas of the code.
			</p>

		<div id="navigator">
			<h2>Navigator</h2>
			<h4>Clark's "Feelings"</h4>
			<p>
				Don't second guess yourself when navigating, you are supposed to be directing someone.
			</p>
			<h4>James's "Feelings"</h4>
			<p>
				I generally feel more comfortable as the navigator if I feel we're on roughly the same level - this way I can just vocalize my thought process and lay out a high-level path for the driver.
