                            Like any tool, the success of the tool is dependent upon the proper use of said tool. JavaScript is a powerful tool when used properly, with more similarities than differences to other multi-purpose scripting languages. Read my thoughts on JavaScript's popularity in web development, JavaScript's strengths, and JavaScript's weaknesses.

                            Jay and I worked on creating a simple Client management program in order to get exposure to working with JavaScript objects. We also got a peek at using JS prototypal inheritance and learned about different scenarios that call for specific data structures.

                        <p>
                            For this assignment, we were supposed to take a
                            <em>rigid</em>page that had content about women in Computing and make that page "responsive" -- that is, optimized to display different content based on the device, screen size, and resolution. Finally, I optimized for huge monitors, desktops, tablets, and mobile phones by using different media queries.

                        <p>
                            If you are confused about the different types of positioning that can be used to position HTML elements, have no fear. In this post, I explain and provide examples to clarify the differences between relative, absolute, fixed, and static positioning. If you don't want to read the whole post, here is the summary: static positioning is the default, and doesn't actually do any positioning (unless overriding previously positioned elements). Relative positioning is positioning of an element relative to itself. Absolute positioning is positioning of an element relative to another element with absolute or relative positioning. Finally, fixed positioning is positioning of an element relative to the viewport or browser window.

                        <p>
                            For this assignment, I used a page that had content about women in Computing and made that page "more semantic" -- that is, I updated the markup in certain places to use more meaningful structure using HTML5 syntax. Secondary (Right) click on the page and select "view page source," which will allow you to view the HTML5 markup like the "article and section" tags.

                            For our first Guided Pairing Session (GPS), we were required to build a simple webpage with HTML and CSS to reflect on the topic of Pair Programming. We spent much of it playing with the driver/navigator roles and started on the page content near the end.

                            In this post, I will wireframe and analyze a page from each of three of my favorite websites -- GitHub, Google Analytics, and Vimeo. It is important to learn wireframing because it allows you to greatly clarify and optimize the design process. Wireframing also reenforces the need to decouple the design from the content.
