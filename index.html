                        If you are confused about the different types of positioning that can be used to position HTML elements, have no fear. In this post, I explain and provide examples to clarify the differences between relative, absolute, fixed, and static positioning. If you don't want to read the whole post, here is the summary: static positioning is the default, and doesn't actually do any positioning (unless overriding previously positioned elements). Relative positioning is positioning of an element relative to itself. Absolute positioning is positioning of an element relative to another element with absolute or relative positioning. Finally, fixed positioning is positioning of an element relative to the viewport or browser window.

                    <p>
                        For this assignment, I used a page that had content about women in Computing and made that page "more semantic" -- that is, I updated the markup in certain places to use more meaningful structure using HTML5 syntax. Secondary (Right) click on the page and select "view page source," which will allow you to view the HTML5 markup like the "article and section" tags.

                        For our first Guided Pairing Session (GPS), we were required to build a simple webpage with HTML and CSS to reflect on the topic of Pair Programming. We spent much of it playing with the driver/navigator roles and started on the page content near the end.

                        Each of these websites, maybe more appropriately called "web apps," are best-in-class products along multiple axes of evaluation -- from usability and design, all the way to performance and utility-value. We have a lot to learn, so let's get started!

                        In this post, I will wireframe and analyze a page from each of three of my favorite websites -- GitHub, Google Analytics, and Vimeo. It is important to learn wireframing because it allows you to greatly clarify and optimize the design process. Wireframing also reenforces the need to decouple the design from the content.
