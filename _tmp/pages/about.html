        <p>
          Software engineering satiates my desire to solve large problems with magic &mdash; symbols, semantic reference, circuitry, and a dash of electricity. I am rarely more satisfied than when building software.

          I tend to view most technologies as disposable, so I focus on the general and invariant principles behind the technologies. That being said, my current interests center around the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>'Languages':</strong> JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, Unix Shell, SQL, KIF, HOL
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Frameworks and Libraries:</strong> Node, Express, Sinatra, Rails, jQuery, React, Backbone, Angular, Ember, Meteor, Sail, Locomotive
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Database Tech:</strong> MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL, CouchDB, Neo4j, Cassandra, MySQL
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Methodologies:</strong> All things lean, agile, and funky-fresh
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Trends:</strong> Cognition as a Service (CaaS), Xiki shell, formal semantic ontology integration into big data work, open knowledge bases, and robots and shit
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Currently Exploring:</strong> Go, Scala, Clojure, Python, Java, Swift, C, Cython, Erlang, Lisp

        <p>
          My open-source-interests include web application frameworks, dev tools, machine learning libraries, natural language processing libraries, knowledge representation frameworks, and anything cool.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am interested in building products that are novel, helpful to a large portion of society, fun to use, and contain interesting technical problems to solve.

    <h2>Metalogic and Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      It's no surprise that I enjoy building software, given my fascination with artificial symbolic languages. In my studies, this fascination manifested itself as a passion for complex systems, particularly those constructed in symbolic logic. My thought always seems to revolve around topics in and in-between metalogic, science, philosophy, and software engineering.
    </p>
    <ul class="about-list">
      <li><a href="#" class="disabledAnchor"><i class="fa fa-subscript big-icon"></i></a>
        <p>
          My metalogical pursuits focus on the construction of 'non-classical' logical systems, particularly deontic, temporal, and modal logics &mdash; I would like to be able to formally specify normative discourse so that computers can capture the large amount of normative talk on the web and infer over it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also like to get my hands dirty with knowledge representation formats, particularly those based on formal predicate logic. I see the ability to construct bullet-proof semantic ontologies and apply them to our current data as foundational in creating large-scale machine learning and consistent inference. I am particularly enthralled by trying to specify large bodies of law, medical theory and record-data, and public knowledge.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><a href="#" class="disabledAnchor"><i class="fa fa-puzzle-piece big-icon"></i></a>
        <p>
          My thinking styles are heavily influenced by the sciences and philosophies of science. I think this is related to my fascination with complex systems that display emergent properties. I see the world through a filter of relativistic and quantum mechanical physics, neo-evolutionary biological theory, neurophysiological thought, and different perspectives from computer science.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><a href="#" class="disabledAnchor"><i class="fa fa-book big-icon"></i></a>
        <p>
          My 'classic' philosophical desires always come back to the dead German dudes &mdash; Kant, Nietzsche, and Wittgenstein. This is probably also where I get my flare for melodrama and eclectic thought.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><a href="#" class="disabledAnchor"><i class="fa fa-sitemap big-icon"></i></a>
        <p>
          Finally, my philosophical wheelhouse is the pursuit of clarity around normativity, language, mind, science, and logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of the above don't interest me in the <em><strong>slightest,</strong></em> relative to the <em><strong>ties</strong></em> between all of the above disciplines &mdash; particularly as they fit into and drive the future of software development.

          I am 26 years old, male, very cool, and very uncool. I am also paradoxical.

    <h2>Past Life</h2>
    <h4>Caution: Braggy</h4>
    <ul class="about-list">
      <li><a href="#" class="disabledAnchor"><i class="fa fa-wrench big-icon"></i></a>
        <p>
          I took countless products from ideation to scale while leading interactive product development across all client properties at <a href="http://creativetrust.com" target="_blank">Creative Trust.</a> Complex businesses with complex user-bases &mdash; businesses demanding large, inexpensive, and extensible platform solutions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><a href="#" class="disabledAnchor"><i class="fa fa-table big-icon"></i></a>
        <p>
          I directed analytics for a web product receiving more than 100 million unique visitors a year. Talk about fun data, testing, and experimentation problems!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><a href="#" class="disabledAnchor"><i class="fa fa-usd big-icon"></i></a>
        <p>
          I led all inbound marketing for <a href="http://songlyrics.com" target="_blank">a website</a> receiving more than 5 million visitors a month from organic search engine traffic alone.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><a href="#" class="disabledAnchor"><i class="fa fa-cubes big-icon"></i></a>
        <p>
          Finally, I studied with <a href="http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/index.html" target="_blank">Nobel Prize laureates</a> and constructed grand and fanciful theories in metalogic, semantic ontology, philosophy of science, linguistics, and metanormative theory.
