<p>Supposedly, when humans conflict they often respond with shame — a protective affect that allows human groups to stay cohesive while correcting behavior that is averse to the group’s well-being.</p>

<p>For example, telling me that I am being too loud and obnoxious (conflict) in a given setting might result in my shame (affective response) — supposedly an evolutionary adaptation effective at making me less obnoxious without fragmenting our group. The shame I feel supposedly keeps me from responding in a more incendiary manner — thus keeping our group intact while also forcing me to internalize that there was something ‘wrong’ with my behavior.</p>

<p>However, things aren’t as clean as the picture painted above … many adults respond to shame in one of four <em>defensive</em> directions — withdrawal, inward attack, outward attack, and avoidance. These four defensive responses to feelings of shame have been termed the “Compass of Shame” by Dr. L. Nathanson.</p>

<p>In this post, I would like to discuss emotional conflict, shame, and some of my personal experience responding to conflict and shame.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="fun-part">Fun Part</h2>

<p>The hardest part of this post was coming up with the antecdote to ground the discussion … It is amazing how defensively my mind has pushed memories of conflict out of my mind, especially the conflicts where I was largely at fault.</p>

<p>After removing a few layers of insecurity and defense-mechanisms I was able to cast my mind back to a very educational emotional conflict at a former workplace. This conflict centered around communication-style differences between myself and a couple of current employees.</p>

<p>I was a raw 24 year-old fresh out of graduate school with experience working in technology startup environments with my buddies in SF or Chicago. I was entering a 40 year-old organization with strict cultural enforcement, brand unity, and more traditional retail product models — located in the South …</p>

<p>I was a maverick data-obsessed techy coming into an organization with the purpose of changing the organization’s digital operations — I was supposed to bring us into the NewNew Age of data and interactive products.</p>

<p>The people that I was going to be working with were of a very different type. First, the majority of my colleagues were women (my two bosses were men, everyone else was a woman). Second, the majority of my colleagues were from the South. Third, the majority of my colleagues had spent their careers working in the Christian/Country music and video retail market producing acts like Steven Curtis Chapman and creating products like VeggieTales. Fourth, the office communication style was much more passive than my usual direct communication style. Finally, the majority of my colleagues were older than me by a decade or three.</p>

<p>I was set up for failure. This young hippie/thug/California-surfer-boy/techy was supposed to come into an established <em>traditional and Southern</em> company and build an interactive product suite from the ground up while also getting people to start making decisions based on data instead of opinion.</p>

<p>Oh man did I act like an idiot when I first got there …</p>

<hr />

<p>First mistake — opening my mouth anytime within the first two months.</p>

<p>Second mistake — not opening my ears enough within the first two months.</p>

<p>Third mistake — no awareness of concepts related to emotional intelligence.</p>

<hr />

<p>So, what actually <em>happened?</em></p>

<p>Well, I tried to <em>force</em> change on people — new techniques, models, processes, emotions, etc. This resulted in frustration on my part — why is everyone resisting such obviously beneficial change!? This resulted in frustration on the part of my colleagues — I was making this company run before that little spit-f*ck was even born! Who does he think he is talking to?</p>

<p>I was barely aware of the possible resentment that would arise from being younger, different, and too aggressive. I definitely hadn’t internalized the possibility of resentment.</p>

<p>Conflict source: ‘being on different pages’ — I assumed that if I was hired to make changes, then everyone must have bought into the changes! My colleagues were not on that page … As soon as we opened up communication enough to realize that we actually all wanted the same thing — happiness and successful products — we were able to look past the details of <em>execution</em> and align ourselves to the larger goal.</p>

<p>Over time, I would have to show that my methods were a more effective way to reach the larger goal than the methods that were in place before I was hired. However, I thought that I could show the value of my methods by barfing knowledge in my colleagues faces.</p>

<p>Conflict source: talking instead of listening — if I had spent more time listening to my colleagues’ current approaches and problems, I would have been much more effective at showing the value of my approach by solving their actual problems. Also, I would have quickly seen that I could learn ridiculous amounts of great stuff from them that could be integrated into my approach to make me better.</p>

<p>By the end of the 3rd week, getting anything done was akin to pulling teeth <em>sans</em> anesthesia and pain-killers.</p>

<p>So, come my first monthly review with my boss (former VP of the Books group of Amazon) … I spend the first 30 minutes of the meeting performing a self-review of my performance as requested. We get to the end of the meeting and it is time for the boss’ feedback.</p>

<p>“From a technical and value-add perspective, you have done a phenomenal job … BUT, I have some feedback about your communication and social skills within the office …”</p>

<p>Uh-oh.</p>

<p>I won’t go into the details, but he basically told me that everyone in the office thought I was arrogant, brusque, difficult to communicate with, and pretty much an alien species. He used words like ‘extremely direct,’ ‘gun-slinger’, ‘aggressive,’ ‘needing some tact,’ <em>ad nauseaum</em>.</p>

<p>If I hadn’t ‘found’ the company a substantial amount of money within the first week that was being blown on ineffective paid media that wasn’t noticeable from the way that they were analyzing their data, and if they hadn’t just hired me and paid for my relocation, they probably would have fired me.</p>

<p>So, how did I handle this feedback and the inciting conflict?</p>

<p>I danced all around the <em>Compass of Shame</em> … Firstly, I did the <em>outward attack</em> defensive response to feeling shame. I started making excuses, outwardly placing blame on everyone else while also being overly combative towards my boss. Once I calmed down a little bit, I said I would work really hard at changing my social skills and that I appreciated the feedback. I left his office and returned to my desk.</p>

<p>Next came the <em>withdrawal</em> response to shame. This defensive response is characterized by isolating oneself — running or hiding. I sat at my desk and acted like I was working on something that required all my attention for the rest of the afternoon. I felt like I was almost in shock at that point.</p>

<p>I somehow drove home without crashing, arriving just in time to start my <em>avoidance</em> phase. Denial is done well in the Feusier family. Distraction through intoxicants was also in the mix. I was going to make my brain ignore the problem for the evening.</p>

<p>Waking up the next morning, I was primed for the <em>inward attack.</em> I felt like a big bag of shit. My whole body hurt. My ego had a substantial contusion. I had forgotten to feed my dog the night before, due to my biochemical state at the time. Hitting rock bottom made “my face nod in agreement” — as Mos Def might say. I turned my gaze inward and started firing artillery rounds.</p>

<p>How deluded am I? Does everyone think I am an asshole? I am definitely going to get fired and then never hired again because the whole world will know that I am difficult to work with. I am an idiot. How did I not see this coming? How could I treat my favorite buddy in the whole world that way? Who doesn’t feed a helpless animal that they are supposed to take care of? And so it goes, for quite a while.</p>

<p>After this period of self-flagellation, plus exercise, a shower, and much doggy spoiling and treats, I was finally ready to confront my shame head-on and in a way that is healthy. I was jumping off of the <em>Compass of Shame,</em> and ready to reflect ‘objectively.’</p>

<p>I began to analyze the situation from other perspectives. I started to soften my negative attitudes towards my colleagues while also realizing that my attitude towards myself needed to be examined — maybe I was being to easy on myself and too hard on others? This change of perspective was the trick.</p>

<p>To handle the original conflict — I was now ready to go back to my colleagues with my tail between my legs, my mouth full of humble pie, and my head covered in shit because it had been so far up my ass — I needed to apologize.</p>

<p>Next, I needed to listen to my colleagues. The <em>real</em> kind of listening — you know, the kind of listening where you aren’t just thinking of things to say or waiting for your turn to interject.</p>

<p>By listening, I was able to pick up on their interests, their problems, their communication styles, their values, their outside work lives, and more.</p>

<p>The next step was engaging them on <em>their</em> terms, not just mine. Spending more time talking about what happened on Downtown Abbey the night before was worth the investment. We began to actually like each other, which led to our working relationship beginning to click. Showing them pictures of my dog and giving them step-by-step recaps of my dating-life from the previous weekend allowed me to make them laugh, make myself laugh, and start to build relationships that would help us all do a better job and have more fun.</p>

<p>Starting to become aware of my behaviors that triggered averse reactions, I learned to use more positive phrasing, raise the pitch of my voice so that I don’t sound as aggressive or bored, validate all contributions <em>first</em> even if they need to be modified, slow the introduction of change and always bridge-build if making changes, use more ‘open’ body postures, pay more attention to breathing and physiological feedback, make my colleagues feel comfortable and not defensive when talking to me, and much more.</p>

<hr />

<p>Over my next 16 months at that company, I had a wonderful experience — making great friends, launching a silly amount of new interactive products, learning to become more than an individual contributor, learning to manage direct reports that are younger and older than myself, learning a craft, learning more than I could have imagined about new markets, business models, technologies, people, and myself.</p>

<p>If I can try to extract a lesson from my diary-like narrative above, it would be the following message.</p>

<p>When trying to minimize and resolve conflict, it is important to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>listen first</li>
  <li>focus on breathing and getting bodily feedback about intense emotional states</li>
  <li>try to index your behaviors to others’ reactions</li>
  <li>everything needs to be phrased ‘positively’ even if the content is critical</li>
  <li>be a cool person and not an asshole — make friends!</li>
  <li>be aware that something as simple as your posture, tone of voice, pitch of voice, or facial expression could be the thing that makes people love you or hate you</li>
  <li>slow down and breathe breathe breathe</li>
  <li>dance like no one is watching</li>
</ul>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p><strong><em>Clark</em></strong></p>
