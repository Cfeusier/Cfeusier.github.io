      <em><strong>Lernhow</strong></em> provides 5-step guides to knowledge. Don't search sprawling wikis for information on how to do something &mdash; come <a href="https://lernhow.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Lernhow</strong></em></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>Lernhow</strong></em> is a project I completed in a <strong>week</strong> sprint while I was studying at Hack Reactor. From ideation to launch, <em><strong>Lernhow</strong></em> was created by myself, <a href="http://raghuvirkasturi.com/" target="_blank">Raghuvir Kasturi</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ekeric13" target="_blank">Eric Kennedy</a>. <em><strong>Lernhow</strong></em> was built with the follow technologies: <em>MongoDB, Mongoose ORM, Node.js, Express, Backbone, Underscore, jQuery, SASS, Bourbon, Neat, Gulp, Heroku, Bluebird, Bcrypt, Mocha, Chai, and more</em>.
    </p>

    <ul class="learning-objectives">
      <li>Advanced routing on both the client and server-side</li>
      <li>Internal and external API creation</li>
      <li>Custom CSS framework built with modular SASS mixins</li>

    <h2><em>Linguist</em></h2>
    <h3><a href="http://linguistv2.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">Demo</a> | <a href="https://github.com/oceanshells/HumpbackSeahorses" target="_blank">Source</a></h3>
    <p>
      <em><strong>Linguist</strong></em> allows people all around the world to talk to each other in different languages by automatically translating messages for them. Our app speaks for them, in a language they don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>Linguist</strong></em> was completed in a <strong>four-day</strong> sprint while I was a studying at Hack Reactor. This project was given to myself, <a href="https://github.com/omarCA" target="_blank">Omar Alvarez</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ekeric13" target="_blank">Eric Kennedy</a>, as a legacy project &mdash; we extended a large codebase into a whole new product. <em><strong>Linguist</strong></em> was built with the follow technologies: <em>Microsoft Translator API, GitHub API, MongoDB, Mongoose ORM, Node.js, Express, Socket.io, Backbone, Underscore, jQuery, Karma, Gulp, Bash, Windows Azure, and more</em>.
    </p>
    <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
    <ul class="learning-objectives">
      <li>Background workers, task runners, and shell scripting</li>
      <li>Web-socket communication between server and clients</li>
      <li>Consumption and integration of multiple external APIs</li>
      <li>Construction of public emoji-fetcher API</li>
      <li>Translation, internationalization, and multi-lingual compatibility</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><em>ChitChat</em></h2>
    <h3><a href="https://chitchatroom.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Demo</a> | <a href="https://github.com/Cfeusier/chitchat" target="_blank">Source</a></h3>
    <p>
      This is a project I completed in a <strong>two-day</strong> sprint while I was studying at Hack Reactor. ChitChat was built on top of <em>Node</em>, <em>Express</em>, and <em>MongoDB</em>, with minimal knowledge of those technologies before starting. I built the client for this project with a fellow engineer (Eric Kennedy), and I built the server by myself.
    </p>
    <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
    <ul class="learning-objectives">
      <li>Node framework basics</li>
      <li>Node integration with Express</li>
      <li>Node and Express integration with MongoDB</li>
      <li>Server-agnostic client architecture (switch out old Parse.com server with new Node server)</li>
      <li>CORS-capable server</li>
      <li>Clean, modular code</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><em>Shortenz</em></h2>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/Cfeusier/shortenz" target="_blank">Source</a></h3>
    <p>
      This is a project I completed during a <strong>two-day</strong> sprint while studying at Hack Reactor. Shortenz was built using <em>Node, Express, SQLite, Backbone, Handlebars, EJS, Passport, Bcrypt, OAuth2, Github API, Bookshelf, Knex, jQuery,</em> and <em>Underscore</em>. The objective of this project was to architect and construct a secure authentication system on top of Node and Express. The link-shortening and user-experience aspects of the project were secondary to the authentication system.
    </p>
    <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
    <ul class="learning-objectives">
      <li>Secure authentication</li>
      <li>OAuth2 best practices</li>
      <li>Reusable and modular code</li>
      <li>Integration of Passport, Bookshelf, Knex, and Bcrypt</li>
      <li>Middleware optimization</li>
      <li>Session management</li>
    </ul>
