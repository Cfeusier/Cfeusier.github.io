            Software engineering satiates my desire to solve large problems with magic &mdash; symbols, semantic reference, circuitry, and a dash of electricity. I am rarely more satisfied than when building software.

            I tend to view most technologies as disposable, so I focus on the general and invariant principles behind the technologies. That being said, my current interests center around the following:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>'Languages':</strong> JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, Unix Shell, SQL, KIF, HOL
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Frameworks and Libraries:</strong> Node, Express, Sinatra, Rails, jQuery, React, Backbone, Angular, Ember, Meteor, Sail, Locomotive
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Database Tech:</strong> MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL, CouchDB, Neo4j, Cassandra, MySQL
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Methodologies:</strong> All things lean, agile, and funky-fresh
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Trends:</strong> Cognition as a Service (CaaS), Xiki shell, formal semantic ontology integration into big data work, open knowledge bases, and robots and shit
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Currently Exploring:</strong> Go, Scala, Clojure, Python, Java, Swift, C, Cython, Erlang, Lisp

            My open-source-interests include web application frameworks, dev tools, machine learning libraries, natural language processing libraries, knowledge representation frameworks, and anything cool.

            I am interested in building products that are novel, helpful to a large portion of society, fun to use, and contain interesting technical problems to solve.

        <h2 class="primary--text text--darken-1 display-1">Metalogic and Philosophy</h2>

            It's no surprise that I enjoy building software, given my fascination with artificial symbolic languages. In my studies, this fascination manifested itself as a passion for complex systems, particularly those constructed in symbolic logic. My thought always seems to revolve around topics in and in-between metalogic, science, philosophy, and software engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            My metalogical pursuits focus on the construction of 'non-classical' logical systems, particularly deontic, temporal, and modal logics &mdash; I would like to be able to formally specify normative discourse so that computers can capture the large amount of normative talk on the web and infer over it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also like to get my hands dirty with knowledge representation formats, particularly those based on formal predicate logic. I see the ability to construct bullet-proof semantic ontologies and apply them to our current data as foundational in creating large-scale machine learning and consistent inference. I am particularly enthralled by trying to specify large bodies of law, medical theory and record-data, and public knowledge.
          </p>

          <p>
            My thinking styles are heavily influenced by the sciences and philosophies of science. I think this is related to my fascination with complex systems that display emergent properties. I see the world through a filter of relativistic and quantum mechanical physics, neo-evolutionary biological theory, neurophysiological thought, and different perspectives from computer science.
          </p>
        </div>

          <p>
            My 'classic' philosophical desires always come back to the dead German dudes &mdash; Kant, Nietzsche, and Wittgenstein. This is probably also where I get my flare for melodrama and eclectic thought.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <v-icon left large class="primary--text text--lighten-1">bubble_chart</v-icon>
          <p>
            Finally, my philosophical wheelhouse is the pursuit of clarity around normativity, language, mind, science, and logic.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of the above don't interest me in the <em><strong>slightest,</strong></em> relative to the <em><strong>ties</strong></em> between all of the above disciplines &mdash; particularly as they fit into and drive the future of software development.
