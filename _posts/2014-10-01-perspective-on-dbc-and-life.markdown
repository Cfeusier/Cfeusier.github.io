9. **The mind is constrained and can't change with time in certain areas based on evolutionary history**
10. **Inspiration is bi-directional and 'performance' re-enforcing (the more you inspire other people, the more they inspire you, which makes you inspire people even more, which makes other people inspire you even more, which makes you inspire even more people to a larger extent, which makes even more people inspire you to a larger extent, omg I'm dizzy)**
11. **Stress and anxiety are recursive &mdash; stress calls itself repeatedly, passing in it's current level of stress as an argument ... never reaching a base-case, thus spiraling away into infinite stress and anxiety, until your brain shuts down from over-consumed memory ... Stack level too deep, yo ... can - not - com - pute ...**
12. **Laughter makes for more laughter ... better performance ... oh yea, and happiness**

14. **Normative judgments infect descriptive judgments ... use with caution**
15. **If you aren't growing, you are either dead, stagnant, or boring ... and I don't want to be around you**
