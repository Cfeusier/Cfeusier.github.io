<p>I like trees. All kinds of trees — concrete and abstract. Redwoods, Oaks, search trees, decision trees, fruit trees, DOM trees, Christmas trees, and more.</p>

<p>They are powerful beyond common recognition. Oxygen, life, shelter, food, beauty, computational efficiency, and more are provided by trees when we interact with them in the right ways.</p>

<p>Don’t get offended when I say this:</p>

<blockquote>you don't like trees enough.</blockquote>
