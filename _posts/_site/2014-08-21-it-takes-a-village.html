<p>If you have ever seen <em>Varsity Blues</em> and the TV show <em>the O.C.</em>, then you pretty much know what high school was like for me. Take a town’s obsession with football, particularly producing college and pro quarterbacks, and mix with a wealthy-white California-bubble – you have my high school town. <strong><em>Forbes</em></strong> was very wrong for ranking my town the 2nd most friendly town in America – we are savages.</p>

<p>Around town, your performance in life (particularly athletically) was <em>everyone’s</em> business, especially if you were the quarterback. Keep in mind, this 16,000 person town has produced 17 olympians, pro quarterbacks, college quarterbacks with a 38-2 starter’s record and a national championship, Cam Newton’s Quarterback Coach for the Carolina Panthers, <em>ad nauseam</em> (not to mention, the countless Fortune 500 Executives, millionaires and billionaires, famous artists, Hollywood bigwigs, etc.). If you were playing well and winning games – you were living like Jordan Belfort in <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em>. If you were losing or playing poorly – you were the goat wearing a very heavy and thorny crown. Well, I was the quarterback.</p>

<p>Why am I telling you this? Because this all relates closely to how I think of feedback and working with others. I have some good and very bad habits from those experiences, and I have already noticed that I will be thankful for a lot of them, but fighting others throughout my time at DBC. I have learned to take poorly-framed feedback – feedback that isn’t specific, actionable, and kind – with a large grain of salt. But, I have learned to hide behind a defensive feedback shell for most other feedback even if it is specific, actionable, and kind. I only take feedback well from a specific set of people whom I trust deeply. I need to remove this defensive shell in order to learn efficiently at DBC.</p>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>

<p>When reading the feedback that I was given from my other DBC pairs and group members throughout phase 0, I felt some fantastic emotions. The feedback was genuinely encouraging and phenomenally kind. I have certain social issues that I am particularly insecure about going into this whole DBC process, so receiving extremely nice words about the very issues that I am insecure about was just what I needed.</p>

<p>I am still waiting for feedback that is more difficult to process dispassionately – then, I am sure I will feel a much wider range of emotions.</p>

<p>Some of the feedback was <em>directly</em> helpful. Some of the feedback was obviously ‘diplomatic,’ but containing a core of constructive criticism under the covers, and thus <em>indirectly</em> helpful. Luckily, only a small portion of the feedback lived in generalities-land and was useless.</p>

<p>Because I am so acclimated to mean and usually useless feedback, I am slowly removing the shell that ignored feedback from anyone other than a small circle. That small circle is now the whole developer community, particularly DBC members.</p>

<p>I <em>consistently</em> received feedback that I need to be more assertive as navigator, so I will work hard to improve this throughout future pairing sessions (as long as I don’t get too assertive!).</p>

<p>Finally, for me, writing feedback was made difficult by my inability to give constructive feedback that is still perceived as kind by other people. I have been spending ridiculous amounts of time on writing feedback, and I have also been trying to improve my meta-feedback scores to make sure that I am on track. I have noticed that this continual attention to giving specific-actionable-kind feedback has bled into other parts of my life, in a positive way. Neuroplasticity and such, right? Overall, the feedback process has been a healthy and stretching experience for me, and I am glad that DBC requires this as part of the curriculum.</p>

<h2 id="pairing">Pairing</h2>

<p>Pairing with another person to solve challenges has been a rewarding though occasionally trying experience. I enjoy working with another person for the most part, but I am just not <em>used to</em> doing it often. The process is so contingent upon the pair being synced, there seems to be a larger chance of failure than individual work. Once I was able to get past this <em>newness</em>, I was able to see that there is a far larger change of success when pairing, if the pairing is done well.</p>

<hr />

<p>Overall, what are my thoughts on using community feedback and pairing to guide my learning? <strong><em>I think that it takes a village to raise an expert</em></strong>. Becoming an expert requires learning things that you have to get from a community of practitioners. That is the difference that I will grasp onto between a community of by-standers’ feedback and a community of practitioners’ feedback – the latter is something that I need to become a software craftsman of the level that I envision.</p>
