<p>The <em>Prototypal Class</em> pattern is fundamental to JavaScript, especially object-oriented JavaScript. The important characteristics of the <em>Prototypal Class</em> pattern are the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>shared functionality is stored in a container object outside the constructor function object (shared methods are <em>not</em> stored as properties on the instance created within the constructor)</li>
  <li>instance-by-instance differentiation is done in the constructor</li>
  <li><strong>failed property lookup is delegated</strong> to the container object holding the desired shared methods</li>
</ol>

<p>This pattern only creates a single instance of each shared method, regardless of how many instances of the ‘class’ are created, thus saving overhead.</p>

<p>This is the pattern on top of which the pseudo-classical pattern is built — adding some syntactic sugar. So, because of the frequency of use of the pseudo-classical pattern, it is important to understand this prototypal class pattern first.</p>

<p>Let’s close by dissecting the important parts of the example above:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lines 1 - 5: the constructor function
    <ul>
      <li>line 2: create an empty object and delegate its failed property lookups to the <strong>exampleMethods</strong> object</li>
      <li>line 3: add an example ‘differentiator’ property to the empty object</li>
      <li>line 4: return the new object</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>lines 7 - 14: method container object with example methods</li>
</ul>

<p>We can now create as many <code>Example</code> instances as we want, all with access to the methods contained within <code>exampleMethods</code>. It is as simple as <code>var example = Example();</code>.</p>
