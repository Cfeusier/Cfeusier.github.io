<p>I have felt the happiest, proudest, and most satisfied in life when I experience situations involving the pursuit of knowledge, pleasure, status, and close relationships.</p>

<p>Ignoring the fact that happiness, pride, and satisfaction are <strong><em>themselves</em></strong> second-order <em>values</em> that could be questioned in their own right, they are useful as measuring sticks against which to evaluate my life. If I can find out the values involved in making me happy, proud, and satisfied, then I have a winning formula — I just need to embody those values, and I will be happy, proud, and satisfied, <em>ceteris paribus.</em></p>

<p>I have been <em>happyproudisfied</em> when I am pursuing knowledge, seeking pleasure, basking in status, and building close relationships. <em>A fortiori,</em> if I want to be <em>happiproudisfied,</em> then I should pursue knowledge, seek pleasure within moderation, earn status, and build close relationships.</p>

<p>I am going to focus the rest of this post on the pursuit of knowledge and close relationships. I think that pleasure and status-seeking are more characteristic human values/attributes — that is, they are ‘further down’ the evolutionary timeline — so it makes sense to focus on my freakish obsession with gaining new knowledge and my weird social relationships. At least it will be more entertaining.</p>

<p>The pursuit of knowledge is important to me because I value the internal and external power that knowledge brings, <em>in and of itself.</em> Close relationships with other people — family, friends, and a significant partner — are too complex to say exactly why they are important to me, but it probably has something to do with evolution, physiology, and social learning. At another level, it is probably because close relationships make me feel engaged, loved, pleasured, supported, part of a group, wanted, intellectually stimulated, etc. — all things that make me <em>happyproudisfied.</em></p>

<p>In general, I try to live up to these values (disagree = 1 : agree = 5):</p>

<ul>
  <li>pursuit of knowledge : 4</li>
  <li>building close relationships : 2.5</li>
</ul>

<p>Do I think my values can help me mediate stereotype threat if I recognize I feel it?</p>

<p><strong><em>Yes.</em></strong> Values provide ‘higher-order’ goals to hang onto when we feel discouraged, unmotivated, or afraid. If I am freezing in the face of my recognition of stereotype threat, I can choose to focus my energy on my values instead — ideally, those values will act as a guiding light and goal towards which to aim, while also distracting me from my paralysis in the face of stereotype threat.</p>
