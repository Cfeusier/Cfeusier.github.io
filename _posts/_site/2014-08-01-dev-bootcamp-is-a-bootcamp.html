    The DBC experience seems to be intense, challenging, fun, and overwhelming in all the right ways.

<p><em>I see myself engaging this type of culture like diving off a cliff headfirst with eyes wide open.</em></p>

<p>I haven’t been this motivated, engaged, excited, passionate, and stubborn to succeed in my life. I also have never felt so absolutely vulnerable to the world. My expectations of DBC haven’t changed much, because they were never overly specific. I want to go into DBC with the attitude that I am going to make it awesome regardless of whether or not it corresponds exactly to my prior expectations. When I used to complain to my dad about why I got a bad grade, I always heard – “don’t let the teacher get in the way of the learning.” I think this journey is going to be one of not letting <em>myself</em> in the way of my own learning.</p>

<p>I am really excited to be walking to Seattle with everyone. I am most nervous that I will not be happy with the amount of steps I am taking relative to others. Some at 100 steps, some at 5. That’s not a big difference when compared to the complete amount of steps to Seattle, I just need to internalize that…</p>

<p>I am super nervous about getting enough sleep to function well, which seems silly, but I seem to be anxious about it.</p>

<p>The list of ideas in the box on the left are the ideas that struck me while watching <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef’s Fireside Chat video</a>. Here is how I unpack them…</p>

<p>First and foremost, <strong><em>Dev Bootcamp</em></strong> is a bootcamp. Remembering that will help me keep my intensity up.</p>

<p>Next, DBC will demand and feed my intensity. Intensity for life, learning, development, programming, and people.</p>

<p>As a bootcamp, this will require effort and will. As Shereef made clear, raw intelligence isn’t a distinguisher in this craft, but effort and hunger are. As Stephen King is quoted, “talent is a wonderful thing, but it won’t carry a quitter.”</p>

<p>Dev Bootcamp should act as a catalyst in my life – DBC should accelerate my learning and life goals, and if I am not accelerating rapidly, then <strong><em>I am doing something wrong</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Like most things in life, when there is uncertainity and a rapidly changing world, it makes most sense to iteratively experiment with everything that matters to you. DBC is an experiment, which also gives DBC boots agency and responsibility to help drive the experiment.</p>

<p>DBC isn’t a restaurant, and if you can’t stand the heat, then get out of the kitchen.</p>

<p>DBC isn’t a grocery store. If you want to peruse the goods passively, then go to a grocery store. DBC is a farm. Work for your keep.</p>

<p>Intense experiences lend themselves to group solidarity. Make friends, keep friends, be generous with your time and thought, and we will form great bonds as we struggle together to make strides in our lives.</p>

<p>This is a rite of passage … make it count, enjoy it, cherish it, work for it, and make sure to make it through.</p>

<h4 style="color: #00688B;">We will make the DBC experience great.</h4>
