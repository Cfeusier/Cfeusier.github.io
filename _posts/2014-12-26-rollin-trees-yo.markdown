I like trees. All kinds of trees &mdash; concrete and abstract. Redwoods, Oaks, search trees, decision trees, fruit trees, DOM trees, Christmas trees, and more.

They are powerful beyond common recognition. Oxygen, life, shelter, food, beauty, computational efficiency, and more are provided by trees when we interact with them in the right ways.

Don't get offended when I say this:

<blockquote>you don't like trees enough.</blockquote>
