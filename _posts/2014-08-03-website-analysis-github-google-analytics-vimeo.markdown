In order to get smarter about web design and user experience practice, I am going to analyze three opponents <em>much smarter</em> than I -- my favorite websites:
<li><a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a></li>
<li><a href="http://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a></li>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a></li>


Each of these websites, maybe more appropriately called "web apps", are <em>best-in-class</em> products along multiple axes of evaluation -- from usability and design, all the way to performance and utility-value. We have a lot to learn, so let's get started with GitHub.

<h3>GitHub | Utility Value</h3>

I am now using <a href="http://github.com">GitHub.com</a> daily. I chose GitHub primarily for its usefulness as a tool for individuals to use to make social impact. This social impact can already be seen in the rapid growth of GitHub's influence over:
<li>Social collaboration</li>
<li>Large-scale software reuse and efficiency-gains</li>
<li>Social gamification</li>
<li>Easy version control integration</li>
<li>Hosting and storage for projects</li>


These influences of GitHub are expanding quickly -- here are some of the "lower-level" product features that I think are accounting for this popularity.


GitHub is very "beginner friendly" relative to other Version Control systems. The experience for a new user landing on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub.com</a> is quite nice. The design is very clean with sharp contrasts, lots of whitespace, and very little clutter. This allows the beginner to figure out what to do, how to do it, and why to do it, very quickly.


Next, GitHub's "logged-out" pages (marketing to new users to signup) excel at highlighting important product features, but more importantly, those pages incentivize you to switch to GitHub if you are using different Version Control system by <em><strong>lowering switching costs</strong></em> for you. For example, if you use Subversion version control tools, you can use GitHub with no ill-effects (try using Git with subversion only services and see if it works :).


Using GitHub, I feel motivated. There is an energy flowing through the web app -- think about it, over 13.5 million repositories have been created already. The world is building things. They are building things <em>together</em>. They are building things together, <em>on GitHub</em>.


My lack of attention to certain UX features and design elements in this discussion is purposeful -- GitHub is successful from a UX perspective by <em>getting out of the way of the user</em>. With minimal design elements, lots of whitespace, a simple color pallete of white, black, grey and occasional blue accents, this web application allows users to focus on their projects.

<p style="font-size: 9pt;">
    <strong>N.B.</strong>
    My only stylistic complaint is the code-highlighting theme and fonts. My eyes have problems reading the GitHub code compared to other code-highlighting/formatting styles.

<h3>Google Analytics | Information Architecture</h3>

Up until recently, I was a Product Manager and Digital Business Analyst, which means that I used <a href="http://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> (GA, hereforth) more in my life than any other web application. I am continually impressed by the GA product for a few reasons:
<li>Information architecture at its finest</li>
<li>Utility and power of results</li>
<li>Large-scale long-term business benefits</li>
<li>Simple, built-in documentation for users</li>
<li>Flexible enough for hassle-free customizations</li>
<li>Integrations with other services that customers use frequently</li>


GA does a good job on its "marketing" pages, in a few ways. GA provides easy access to two-levels of information: simple/quick vs. deep information that only power-users would engage with for the most part (though I am only saying that this type of setup is right for their situation, not all products). They acheive this <em>layering</em> of information with some simple design tricks and some interactivity. For example, take the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/features/">GA Features</a> page -- the page is layed out in categories that most users of this type of tool would understand clearly (easy to test -- see "category usability testing" with index cards). Next, each category has sub-categories with clear names. These sub-categories run the gamut of things that businesses want to measure, analyze, and get out of their web-analytics base-suite from advertising and campaign performance and attribution modeling to granular ecommerce reporting.


Each of the sub-categories has a small <em>toggle</em> button, which allows the user to quickly see the whole list, but also easily expand the sub-category to get more information as desired. Each of the <em>expanded</em> sub-categories provides a short text description of the capabilities and benefits in that sub-category.
Based on a quick glance over those sub-categories combined with the heavily penetrated reputation of GA in this space, most people are probably ready to convert at this point. The beauty is that the design choices allowed them to "get out of the way" of the easy conversion by avoiding overloading with unneeded information.


However, you might be wondering about the potential customer who is more rigorous in the due dilligence and research phases -- my mom can't buy a toothbrush without spending weeks reading reviews in order to make her choice. GA has thought of that by including extra information links within the expandable sub-categories below the descriptions of the sub-categories. They have also included links to case-studies which are merchandised with the logos of the companies involved in the case-studies -- very powerful technique, because most of the case-studies were with successful and well-known companies (see, Travelocity, Puma, the last Obama/Biden Presidential Campaign, etc.).


Because I spent too much time with the previous discussion, I am only going to point out that the actual GA app for <em>registered and logged-in</em> users is where all the magic is. A "mature" GA account will have hundreds to thousands of reports, which can be interactively sliced, diced, filtered, drilled into, exported, combined, imported, etc. That doesn't even include a normal GA setup, which will include <em>multiple</em> accounts and organizations.


GA is only useful because the product uses interactive elements like the toggle to allow users to find what they need quickly by hiding a lot of information, and once users find what they need, they can dive deep easily. If GA didn't architect and design the display of information with great care and knowledge about their users, it would be an unusable mess (for some reason, Google AdWords product team hasn't figured this out yet, though the latest redesign was a huge improvement).

<h3>Vimeo | Sexy Design made Simple</h3>

This is more of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQKriKpkW8g&feature=kp">dark horse</a> for me, in that I rarely use <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a> (because I don't really watch a whole ton of online video other than Netflix and such). But, if I were to watch a whole ton of video on sites like Vimeo or YouTube, I would choose Vimeo.


I would choose Vimeo for a few reasons (that I think are related): Vimeo seems less busy and cluttered with advertisements than other services like YouTube. Second, the design is much more pleasing to the general public. There are delicately used bright colors and the homepage for users who aren't logged-in even has a gorgeous moving and changing high-res background with a slick, transparent, floating signup/login form and 4 reasons to use Vimeo.


Once logged-in, there are a quantifiable <em>shit-load</em> more advertisments on YouTube than Vimeo. If you upgrade to a premium Vimeo account, you have no advertisements, which is a much nicer aesthetic experience.


Finally, when comparing the design of one of the crucial features of a video product like this, i.e., the player (where you watch the video :), I think that Vimeo beat YouTube again. Vimeo uses a very simple and clean overlay for the controls and extras on the video player, with bright contrasting color on the active elements. This overlay gracefully hides when watching the video. YouTube has the same functionality, but they use a control bar that is fixed to the bottom of the player. This causes the control bar to look fixed, which draws the eyes down to it away from the main video content. The Vimeo controls look like they are floating, which makes your eyes integrate them into the video content in a harmless way.


Finally, the Vimeo website just makes me feel better than other video sites -- the site just has "personality" (example, check out their 404 pages). I need to remember that -- i.e., the power of writing good copy and having fun designing a web site or app so that your personality shows through the product.

I don't like making grand summaries -- "I mistrust all systemizers and avoid them" <span style="font-size:9px;">(Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols)</span>. But, for pedagogical purposes I will take a stab at it.
<blockquote>The best web site or application will combine great utility value for the end-user, continually refined information architecture, and an emotive and personable design.</blockquote>
