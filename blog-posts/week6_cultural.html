                    <blockquote>
                        Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/69/5/797/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        That is a fancy way of saying that stereotype threat occurs when someone is in a situation that causes expectations of failure to be considered confirmation of a negative stereotype about that person's group. Ok, that was even worse. Let me try an example.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jenn is a woman. She feels that women shouldn't be good at math because of stereotypes present in society about women and math, so when she is studying for her math test, she self-handicaps and doesn't retain the information as she would in another subject. When she takes the math test, she expects that she should fail because women 'are not good at math.' She is also somehow cognizant that if she fails this test, it will just confirm how 'bad women are at math.' So, she does shitty on the math test.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Claude Steele, the spearhead of stereotype threat research, would describe Jenn as having encountered a stereotype threat, which may have largely contributed to her failure on the test. Steele is famous for his initial studies on "Black college freshmen and sophomores who performed more poorly on standardized tests than White students when their race was emphasized. When race was not emphasized, however, Black students performed better and equivalently with White students" <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">(source)</a>. The results <em><strong>supposedly</strong></em> showed that academic performance is correlated with awareness that "one's behavior might be viewed through the lens of racial stereotypes" (<em>ibid</em>).
                    </p>
                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        If we interpret Steele as most commentators do, then I would argue that<strong> there is no such <em>thing</em> as the "Stereotype Threat"</strong> -- there is no unified or principally demarcable state of affairs that could act as Steele's "Stereotype Threat." Instead, there is an overlap of antecdotes that minorities report feeling a given way when placed in situations with vague similarities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ok, before you get cray cray, let me clarify. There are, <em>of course,</em> legitimate psychological and social phenomena that miniorities experience when in the situations that theorists like Steele have described, and I am sure that these phenomena strongly affect our lives. I am merely stating an argument that runs throughout the literature surrounding the stereotype threat corpus, that is, with our current research status, we can't claim that there is <em><strong>a</strong></em> stereotype threat. It might be the case that we later pin down 10 different types of threats that occur in different scenarios which replace the uniform 'stereotype threat' concept that we posited for working purposes. Or, we might find out that the stereotype threat and other phenomena seemingly unrelated to the stereotype threat are actually caused by something "deeper" causally, which unites stereotype threat with the seemingly unrelated phenomena.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The point is simple: we don't know enough yet to decide if the stereotype threat is a uniform concept or only a useful heuristic given our current epistemic status.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion of the pedantic and contrary part of this post, Steele's theory has been criticized vigorously, and I think rightly so (for the most part), for a variety of theoretical gaps that stem from this inability to carve the world up cleanly at its Stereotype Threat joints. The main problems cited span ambiguity and vagueness to plain lack of empirical support.
                    </p>
                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        If, as is probably more charitable, we interpret Steele's theory as claiming mere <em><strong>descriptive</strong></em> categorization when introducing the stereotype threat concept, then his theory avoids some of the above hints at criticism (though it loses some of its sexiness). Let me explain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We were originally assuming, as most of the commentary, that Steel is claiming that there is really something in the world that corresponds closely to the causal mechanisms of the stereotype threat phenomena as he describes them -- that is, there really is a stereotype threat out in the world obtaining in a way that matches his theory. We then gestured at why that tact seems barren of fruit. Instead, we could interpret Steele as <em>merely</em> claiming that there are a group of phenomena that have a <em>mere</em> resemblance, which could be grouped together for discussion purposes under the name "stereotype threat" until our empirical research and theorizing matures. With this approach, we could wait maturely to mess with ontology until our empirical research catches up, while still using the stereotype threat concept (charitably interpreted) as a heuristic with practical benefits.

                    <h3>The Stereotype Threat as a Heuristic</h3>
                    <p>
                        I see two primary areas where the stereotype threat concept can serve as a heuristic to help combat phenomena associated with the stereotype threat concept. First, the stereotype threat concept helps identify areas of life where self-handicapping is occuring. Secondly, the stereotype threat concept helps identify areas of insecurity related to group-identity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similar to the focus on <em>awareness</em> in the engineering empathy course at DBC, this heuristic starts with awareness. Once you are aware that there is some phenomena in the world that can be described by the stereotype threat concept, the likelihood that you can regulate said phenomena in a healthy way increases greatly. If I am aware that I get angry when someone does a certain action, then I am more likely to regulate that anger in the future (all things being equal + a desire to regulate said anger). Similarily, if I am aware that I self-handicap because of a societal stereotype that I have internalized relative to the group that I identify with, then it is more likely that I can regulate that self-handicapping in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, from the other direction, the stereotype threat concept can help find areas of insecurity related to group-identity -- e.g., spending a few minutes thinking about the stereotype threat concept in relation to your own life will probably bring up a few large insecurities about your identity. For example, I tend to identify with a weird mixture of immigrant thuggery and affluent cosmopolitan intelligensia, so when I think about the stereotype threat concept, I immediately feel insecure about that tension -- will my peformance <em>in anything</em> reenforce <em>anything</em> negative about that inability to identify heterogenously (the ambiguity is purposeful -- I don't want to overshare :)
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Stereotype Threat and I</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am going to focus on how I plan to deal with the stereotype threat if it occurs in the future (particularly, while at DBC), instead of focusing on my past experiences with the stereotype threat -- not because I mind sharing with people, but because I mind sharing with people <em>on a public forum like the internet</em>.
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="opacity: 0.6;">1. What do I plan to do when I feel the stereotype threat or suspect someone else is feeling it?</h4>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Myself:</strong> stop working. Walk around for a minute or two. Breathe deeply. Identify the self-handicapping behavior. Identify an easy check on that behavior. Get motivated. Get back to work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Others:</strong> this depends greatly on context. My relationship with that person will greatly determine the approach. Our embedded context (group or alone, at DBC or somewhere else, etc.) will also determine the approach taken. But, in general, patience, kindness, slow and measured delivery, and <em>listening</em> seem to be the most important factors for broaching sensitive subjects.
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="opacity: 0.6;">2. How will I work to change the environment I'm in to make it more welcoming?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Reading the room accurately is probably the first step. If someone needs attention shifted off of them, then I will do that. If someone seems to need more attention on them, I will do that, etc. Generally, I think patience, attention and courtesy, smiling, and <em>listening</em> will do the trick.
                    </p>
