                        <em>Lame Disclaimer:</em> this will be the least tactful, most vulnerable, most honest and dishonest, and least intelligible of any post on this site. If you don't like that, fuck off.

                        I don't process things well from a single perspective or approach. I process by discursively dancing around and into a knotted casual nexus of past, present, and current states of affairs. External evidence and theory have explanatory power that helps my mental grounding. I can compare my representations and theories of those same affairs measured against criteria of the 'objective' external observables.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That means that I need to play in different media and roles &mdash; academic, philosopher, scientist, developer, male, female, rich, poor, happy, sad, concept-play, word-play, profanity, pathetic sensitivity, <em>ad nauseaum</em>. Ye been warned.

                        Stubborn people who don't ask for help are in trouble in this world. We have a few million years of deep and low-level evolutionary pressure to work together to conquer and succeed (together, lol). This is especially hard for me to own because of some pretty standard gender-role learned-behavior, exacerbated by machismo-culture, special forces military culture, and way too much homogenous-uneducated-male-sporting.

                        Smart and beautiful people ask for help. Hard mothafuckas cry for help sometimes. Busy people stop and help when you really need it. The world feels pain when you feel pain. Holding problems inside yourself in order to avoid burdening other people is exactly what leads to your burden on other people. It is possible to cry in front of people and not feel ashamed &mdash; maybe even feel proud. It is possible to show a side of yourself that disgusts you, but see people looking at you with love and not hate. It is possible to be around people that don't want to hurt you for no reason. It is possible to be happy if you stop hiding yourself &mdash; from the world <em>and</em> yourself.
