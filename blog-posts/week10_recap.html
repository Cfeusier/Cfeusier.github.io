                    <h2>Phase 1 - Week 1 Recap</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <h3>Today is the First Day of the Rest of your Life</h3>
                    <p>
                        Imagine your first day of high school. Freshmen froshie. Nervous. Excited. The older kids probably think you are lame for just being alive. You have heard so much about what high school is like, but you still have no idea what you are in for until you <em><strong>go</strong></em> to high school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, imagine walking into your school and being told to line up in a single-file line with all of the other freshmen to get a tour of the campus. You start walking and your guide is pointing out the quad, the gymnasium, the cafeteria, where to get help, where to park your car, etc. You cover the grounds and your guide starts leading you to the gymnasium to start orientation.  You start to notice a soft but growing noise as you approach the gym. A roar starts building in your ears, and a very real reverberation courses through your body as you can feel the ground shaking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It clicks. Your brain knows what is waiting in that gymnasium ...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your tour guide opens the door and a wave of sound and mental energy crash into you. Your whole entire high school is cheering for you louder and more geniuinely than anyone has ever cheered for you. Every single sophomore, junior, senior, teacher, and staff member is screaming with excitement at your presence. You start walking through a tunnel of people &mdash; the very people who were going to beat you up and make fun of you &mdash; who are now giving you high-fives and welcoming you. Every single person there gives you a high-five. You have a realization &mdash; this is going to be one crazy fucking ride, and you are going to love it.
                    </p>
                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        My dad was one of those annoying special forces meatheads who would say things that he thought were motivational &mdash; ridiculous things like "today is the first day of the rest of your life." It finally makes sense to me. Diving into an intense and transformational bootcamp, with full knowledge that you will come out of it a different person, is like starting your life fresh again ... with 70 people who are lined up cheering you on and high-fiving you at every step (the high-five tunnel actually happened the first morning at DBC).
                    </p>

                    <h3>So What did you Learn at School this Week, Clark?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I had dinner with my parents and some family friends on the Saturday after my first week at DBC. The focus was on DBC and me. I was exhausted and the last thing I wanted to do was recap something that was exhausting that they wouldn't even understand. But as I forced myself to compact a week of experience into something relatable and comprehendable for my family, I started to feel the concepts from the week reorganizing and settling into a comfortable position for the rest of my life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, for the sake of internalizing and deepening my comfort with the concepts of the week, I am going to try to something dangerous &mdash; summarization. Bear in mind, this is high-level summary. Note well, this is a summary of topics that I want to focus on, not the everything from the week.
                    </p>

                        1. Don't EVER, EVER, EVER ... push to master
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are working with a team, and you have 'contributor' access to a repository, do not push to the master branch because you can overwrite all of the content on that branch. Create a new branch and push to that branch &mdash; then submit a 'pull request' so that your team can evaluate your code before intergrating it into the master branch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Recursion ... is a fundamental power of the universe. It can make huge problems dissolve into elegant and tiny solutions &mdash; or it can make small problems into huge problems ... harness the power of the universe with caution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The nitty gritty of recursion is too big of a topic to cover here. The main components are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a base case: infinite recursion is cool but it breaks computers. You need to tell the recursion when to stop, i.e., when a value reaches 5, stop the recursion</li>
                        <li>getting closer to the base case: if your implementation of recursion doesn't get closer to the base case on each recursive call, then you will never reach your base case &mdash; i.e., your computer will keep looping until memory consumption issues terminate the process</li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        3. Iteration
                    </p>
